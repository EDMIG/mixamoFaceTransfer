# mixamoFaceTransfer
A machine learning approach for tracking face expressions and transferring them to Unity3D and mixamo characters

In order to run the code, you will need to use matlab to generate the blendshape coefficients.  The demo.m will generate the txt files shown in the folder “co”.

Copy the coefficients into a Unity directory called “coeffs”.  Import the “test.UnityPackage” to get the Mixamo model.  View the image for the proper setup of the model and scripts.
