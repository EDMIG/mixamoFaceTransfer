In order to run the code, you will need to use matlab to generate the blendshape coefficients.  The demo.m will generate the txt files shown in the folder “co”.

To generate the facial points (files located in pts), we used the [DEST](https://github.com/cheind/dest)  opensource software.  The dest_align command will compute the 68 key points per face.  The pose (files located in pose) were generated by [openface](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace).  FaceLandmarkImg with the gaze parameter will generate the pose files.  Samples are shown in pts and pose folders here.


Copy the coefficients into a Unity directory called “coeffs”.  Import the “test.UnityPackage” to get the Mixamo model.  View the image for the proper setup of the model and scripts.

You can see a sample by copying the text files from “co” into the “coeffs” directory.
